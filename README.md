This project was a personal project created during spring break 2023. I made this to practice functional components in React, as well as hosting a React server on GitHub Pages. In the process, I was able to learn more CSS, and further understand useEffect, useState and JavaScript in general.

(Must use arrow keys to play: not mobile friendly)

For developers:
-Use 'npm run build' to create build
-Then change name of 'dist' folder to 'docs'
-Add to git and changes will be reflected!
